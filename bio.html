				<p id="bio">
				One of my earliest memory about drawing was in elementary school. 
				Every week I would draw something on the black board to decorate 
				the classroom, I did this for fun, not because it is a task.</p> 
				<p id="bio">I started to get formal training in sketching and gouache painting 
				when I was 10 years old, and I was fascinated by how shapes and shades 
				can build such realistic image on my paper. It was really those years 
				of training build a solid foundation on how I see objects and colors when 
				I am painting.</p>
				<p id="bio">After high school, for several years I didn't practice. In 2017 I started 
				to learn oil painting by myself, all those memories rushing back to me, 
				I think I will keep on this hobby now.
				</p>
				<p id="bio">All these works are dedicated to XYX and memories of our past
